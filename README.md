# Tokis E7 Auto Shop Refresh
 A monkey brained gacha gamer with spending problem decided to make this for fun.
 EmaOlay previously made one using pictures but that requires different pictures
 different video settings.
 
 This one only requires to change a single line in the code to match the emulator
 of your choice!
 
 Its got everything you need.
  - scuffed code
  - questionable thought process
  - and a logic of if it works, it works
 
 It doesn't work 100% of the time, maybe missing a bookmark or two once in a while.
 
 Go ahead and change everything to your liking. If you improved it, I hope you share
 it with everyone. :)
 
*Written in Python 3.9.6 incase it doesn't work in future versions*
